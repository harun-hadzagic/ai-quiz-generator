üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before you can run the application, you need to have the following installed and set up on your machine:

Node.js & npm: For the React frontend.

Python 3.x & pip: For the server application.

Ollama: A local LLM server. Follow the instructions on the Ollama website to install and run the application.

A Local Model: You need a model running locally. This project is configured to use the llama3 model. To download and run it, use the following command in your terminal:

ollama run llama3

Alternatively, you can use any other model, but you will need to update the model name in the server.py file.

Modelfile: Ensure you have created a Modelfile with the provided system prompt to customize the model's behavior for quiz generation. You will need to build and run this custom model using the Ollama command-line interface.
